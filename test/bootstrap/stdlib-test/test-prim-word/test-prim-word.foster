//snafuinclude Word "prim-word";

// Types: Word, Word*2, Word/2
//              WordX2  WordO2 (at C level)
//

// zext i32 to Word (or noop)
// trunc Word to i32 (or noop)

// Complication 1: type checking (of literal numbers for conformance against
//                 word types) depends on the eventual size of Word.
//      * Could thread that state through
//      * Could eliminate the Word alias early on
//      * Could be conservative and reject 64-bit literals even on 64-bit platforms.
//      * Could keep Word as a separate abstract type & forbid literals;
//          only allow conversions from explicitly typed/sized literals.

// Complication 2: where do we fix the sizes of words?
//      * Type checking: lose portability of typechecked code.
//      * Later: typechecking can't do all checks!
