* C2F produces mostly-correct source; there are a still a few places
  that need tweaking, such as adding ptrGet calls.

* Performance of the directly translated code is not great, in part
  due to the overhead of the Ptr wrappers, in part due to dynamically
  allocated ref cells for function-local mutable variables.

* A few simple but awkward-to-automate changes boosts performance
  from ~50x slower than C to ~4x slower:

    * Making sure Scanner.buf's type is (Array Int8)
      instead of (Field (Ptr (Ptr Int8))).

    * Altering the scan_token call chain to pass in its "local"
      mutable variables from the caller.

    * Changing those variables to be simple Ref cells instead of Ptrs.

    * Removing the Scanner_nil data constructor and associated code.


* Other performance notes:

  * GC root optimizations matter significantly:

    * Failing to optimize roots results in 5x overhead vs 4x.

    * By assuming non-moving roots, therefore eliding reloads,
      we improve performance from 4x to 3x overhead. (--me-arg=--non-moving-gc)

  * Disabling array bounds checking:
        By itself:                   92M insns, 39M cycles -> ~3.5x overhead
        Along with non-moving roots: 51M insns, 26M cycles: 2.1x
        (foster baseline:           115M insns, 43M cycles)
        (C      baseline:            29M insns, 12M cycles)
