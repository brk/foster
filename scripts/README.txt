These are quick-and-dirty helper scripts to compile and run foster programs.
They are intended to be copied to and run from a sibling directory of the
foster repository.

From such a directory,
    $ ./gotest.sh bootstrap/app/mumurhash2
will (using `test.sh`) compile and run the file
    foster/test/bootstrap/app/murmurhash2/murmurhash2.foster
